## Architecture Improvements Implemented ✅

### UNIX Philosophy Adherence
- [x] Separated handlers into focused, single-purpose files
- [x] Clean interfaces between components
- [x] Composable and testable handler architecture
- [x] **Model consolidation: Single source of truth for all types**
  - [x] Consolidated all models into `pkg/models/` following UNIX principles
  - [x] Eliminated code duplication across 35+ files
  - [x] Created shared, reusable type definitions
  - [x] Used Go type aliases for backward compatibility

### API-First Design
- [x] New batch classifier that uses HTTP API instead of direct services
- [x] Consistent error response format across all endpoints
- [x] Structured logging and metrics collection

### Queue-Based Processing
- [x] High-performance queue system from existing batch processors
- [x] Simplified without unnecessary GPU/hardware optimization
- [x] Smart rate limiting for external API calls

**Note**: Authentication has been temporarily disabled for early development. 
**CRITICAL**: Must be re-enabled before any production deployment.

## Summary of Progress

**Completed**: 
- API-based batch classification system
- Document pagination and filtering
- Async job tracking and monitoring
- Clean handler architecture following UNIX principles

## Latest Implementation Details

### Document Serving Implementation (`GET /api/v1/documents/*`)
**Location**: `internal/handlers/storage.go:ServeDocument`

**Features**:
- **CDN Redirect Support**: Automatically redirects to DigitalOcean Spaces CDN URLs
- **Signed URLs**: Secure, time-limited access with configurable expiration
