# TODO: Production Readiness & Feature Parity

## Feature Parity with Python API

### Missing Endpoints (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] `POST /metadata-field-values` - Get metadata field values with custom filters
- [ ] `GET /all-field-options` - Get all field options in one request
- [ ] `POST /redact-document` - PDF redaction processing (currently only analysis)
- [ ] `GET /api/documents/{file_path:path}` - Direct document serving with CDN redirect

### Recently Added Features ✅
- [x] `GET /api/storage/documents` - Document listing with pagination  
- [x] `GET /api/storage/documents/count` - Document count with filters
- [x] `POST /api/batch/classify` - Async batch classification
- [x] `GET /api/batch/{job_id}/status` - Batch job status monitoring
- [x] `GET /api/batch/{job_id}/results` - Batch job results
- [x] `DELETE /api/batch/{job_id}` - Cancel batch jobs

### Enhanced Features vs Python API ✅
- [x] Cursor-based pagination for large document sets
- [x] Async batch processing with job tracking
- [x] Rate limiting and queue management
- [x] Structured error responses with error codes

## Authentication & Security

### JWT Authentication (PRIORITY: HIGH)
- [ ] **Re-enable JWT authentication for protected routes**
  - Routes currently disabled for development:
    - `POST /api/v1/update-metadata` - Should require authentication
    - `DELETE /api/v1/documents/:id` - Should require authentication
    - `POST /api/batch/*` - Should require authentication for batch operations
  - Location: `cmd/server/main.go` lines 86-90
  - Required: Configure JWT secret and Supabase integration
  - Test with proper JWT tokens before production deployment

### Security Headers & CORS
- [ ] Review and configure CORS settings for production domains
- [ ] Validate all security headers are properly configured
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for public endpoints

## Storage & CDN Integration

### Document Serving (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Implement CDN redirect in `ServeDocument` handler
- [ ] Add support for signed URLs with expiration
- [ ] Add document access logging and metrics

### Storage Optimization
- [ ] Add caching for document metadata listings
- [ ] Implement bulk operations for storage management
- [ ] Add storage metrics and monitoring

## Advanced Processing Features

### Redaction Support (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Complete PDF redaction implementation
- [ ] Add redaction preview and approval workflow
- [ ] Integrate with document versioning

### Search Enhancement
- [ ] Implement search result ranking algorithms
- [ ] Add search query analytics and optimization
- [ ] Support for saved searches and alerts

## Batch Processing & Performance

### Queue Management ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Multi-stage queue processing pipeline
- [x] Rate limiting for external API calls
- [x] Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- [x] Real-time progress monitoring

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add response caching for search results
- [ ] Implement search result pre-loading
- [ ] Add query performance monitoring

## Configuration & Deployment

### Environment Configuration
- [ ] Ensure all production environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] Validate DigitalOcean API token and credentials are secure
- [ ] Configure proper logging levels for production

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Add comprehensive metrics collection
- [ ] Implement health check endpoints for all services
- [ ] Configure alerting for system failures

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Add integration tests with authentication enabled
- [ ] Test all protected endpoints with valid/invalid JWT tokens
- [ ] Performance testing under production load

### API Testing
- [ ] Test document pagination with large datasets
- [ ] Validate batch processing with concurrent jobs
- [ ] Test error handling and recovery scenarios

## Documentation

### API Documentation
- [ ] Update OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- [ ] Add examples for all endpoints
- [ ] Document authentication requirements

### Deployment Documentation
- [ ] Update deployment configuration with authentication enabled
- [ ] Document authentication setup in deployment guides
- [ ] Create runbooks for common operations

## Architecture Improvements Implemented ✅

### UNIX Philosophy Adherence
- [x] Separated handlers into focused, single-purpose files
- [x] Clean interfaces between components
- [x] Composable and testable handler architecture

### API-First Design
- [x] New batch classifier that uses HTTP API instead of direct services
- [x] Consistent error response format across all endpoints
- [x] Structured logging and metrics collection

### Queue-Based Processing
- [x] High-performance queue system from existing batch processors
- [x] Simplified without unnecessary GPU/hardware optimization
- [x] Smart rate limiting for external API calls

**Note**: Authentication has been temporarily disabled for early development. 
**CRITICAL**: Must be re-enabled before any production deployment.

## Summary of Progress

**Completed**: 
- API-based batch classification system
- Document pagination and filtering
- Async job tracking and monitoring
- Clean handler architecture following UNIX principles

**In Progress**:
- Missing endpoint implementations
- Authentication re-enabling
- CDN integration for document serving

**Priority Order**:
1. Re-enable JWT authentication
2. Implement missing endpoints for full Python API parity
3. Complete CDN document serving
4. Add comprehensive testing and monitoring
